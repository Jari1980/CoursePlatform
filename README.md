# CoursePlatform

Java practise exercise with JPA and MySQL.
Project seeds initial data to all tables if userrepository is empty. The project have endpoints for user crud operations in CourseController, this could and maybe would be changed to a UserController.
Ill end this project here for now, if someone want, feel free to proceed with more requests, tests, frontend or whatever:)
